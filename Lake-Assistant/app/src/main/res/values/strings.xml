    "<b>• Read Screen Content:</b> Lake can see and analyze what\'s currently displayed on your screen to understand the context and provide relevant assistance.\n\n"
    "<b>• Perform Actions:</b> Execute touch gestures, taps, swipes, and navigation (Back, Home, Recent Apps) on your behalf based on your voice commands.\n\n"
    "<b>• App Interaction:</b> Open apps, fill forms, scroll through content, and navigate between different screens as requested.\n\n"
    "<b>🔒 Privacy &amp; Data Protection:</b>\n"
    "• All processing happens on Gemini API\n"
    "• No personal data is collected or but it is sent to Google Gemini\n"
    "• Screen content is only accessed when you actively use Lake, otherwise Lake doesnt access screen content\n"
